/*!
 * @brief FSM that controls the AM board.
 *
 * The FSM sequences the reading of the hits, the processing of the data and the
 * writing of the detected roads.
 *
 * Description of the states:
 *
 * IDLE: The FSM is in this state while the AM board is ready to receive new
 * hits. If there is some hit detected, the FSM goes to state RX_HIT.
 *
 * RX_HIT: Receive hits - in this state the AM board reads all the hits into the
 * board. If there is no hit on any layer received, then the FSM goes to the
 * PROCESS_ROAD state.
 *
 * PROCESS_ROAD: The AM board is processing the read hits and creates the roads.
 * This state lasts in this implementation for only one cycle, then the FSM goes
 * to the WRITE_ROAD state.
 *
 * WRITE_ROAD: In the write road state. The AM board writes out all the detected
 * roads. This state lasts until no more roads are in the buffer and then the
 * state goes to idle.
